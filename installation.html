                <p>Video installation, Pico projectors, tracing paper. ~6x8x1'. October 2021.</p>
                <p>I want to become very small, I want to crawl into the screen and look around.</p>
                <!--  <p> Everything in it feels</p>
                <p>so far away from me. I wish my laptop could be like my bedroom: a space I could enter and curl up in </p>
                <p>like a little animal among my most prized possessions. I have ~5 browser windows with up to ~30 tabs</p>
                <p>in each window open at all times: if I close a tab I will forget what is inside. Every time my</p>  
                <p>computer crashes, I choose “Restore all tabs”. I want all my tabs to be stored in bookshelves, </p>
                <p>sorted by topic: PDFs yet to read  |  “News” articles  |  Youtube videos (subsections: music,</p> 
                <p>celebrity interviews, documentaries I will never watch, asmr cooking videos)  |  School stuff  |</p>  
                <p>Obsessions  |  Porn  |  JSTOR  |  etc. I don’t want to Search: I don’t know what I’m looking for!!!</p>
                <p>I want to Browse Google like I would Browse a library: I want to walk among its corridors and pick</p> 
                <p>up its objects, touch them, open them, take what sparks my interest home with me. I want all my</p> 
                <p>information to be material, destructible… stashed safely in an old hallowed building where I can</p> 
                <p>sit quietly for hours. I wish I were typing this from inside my computer.</p>  -->

                <p>Video installation, mosquito netting, bedsheets, monofilament. ~6x8x7'. December 2021.</p>
                <p>An exploration of haptics, interiority, mediation, and memory on/of the screen. Close-up webcam footage of various skins and</p>
                <p>textures (in which I sometimes appear) and a live video feed filming the viewer interact on and between many translucent</p> 
                <p>hanging screens. Inspired by the fantasy of living inside one'scomputer, a 'sequel' of sorts to "Library" (see above), the piece</p> 
                <p>attempts to create a space in which both screen contents and the body of the viewer become both material and immaterial,</p>
                <p>contained by and exceeding the screen.</p>
